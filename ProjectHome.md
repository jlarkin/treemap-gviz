## About TreeMapGViz ##

This project is a **Google Spreadsheet** and **Google Visualization** implementation of the popular [Treemap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemap) graph algorithm.

Tree maps are useful for visualizing **complex hierarchical information** in a small space. Similar to pie charts, tree maps divide the screen into areas that correspond in area to the size of the data points. But tree maps are superior to pie charts as they also convey the hierarchical relationship between the data points. Data points that share the same category are rendered together.
